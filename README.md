## About
My little project about what Belarusians do during war in Ukraine.

I needed something to practice knowledge in web development that I've gained so far. And there is a war going on. And I can draw and design. And I am originaly from Belarus. That's how I came up with this idea.

Project based on random numbers between 0 and the number of images.
